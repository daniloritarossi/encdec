Stand alone software developed in GO Language, allows you to uniquely encrypt the string of the application based on keywords:

- Machine ID
- OS

***It is generally very useful for encrypting passwords***

## Features

- Portability on Windows, MAC and UNIX / LINUX and much more operating systems 
- Crypt and Decrypt string (password) from a shell_exec
- Robust string encryption system in GOLANG
- No further installations are required
- It has no dependencies on the operating system

## Tech

We use a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [GO] - Developed


And of course Danilo itself is open source with a [public repository][daniloritarossi] on GitHub.

## Installation

ENC and DEC STRING requires [public repository][go] v1.17+ installed to run.

If you want compile the code you need to install the dependency with "github.com/denisbrodbeck/machineid"
move to directory installation es: c:\Program Files\Go and put the code

```sh
go get github.com/denisbrodbeck/machineid
```

#### Easy to use

Normally you can use directly the executable **encdec** file already generated and ready to use for LINUX distribution in /src folder of your project  (please visit [Linux Executable v1.0]  ) once loaded into the system you can generate the encrypted password as I describe it

ENCRYPT--> You can run the program from the bash command by running the statement:

```sh
go run main.go ENC PasswordToEncrypt
```

The result is something like:

```sh
encrypted : 26a8d6a84be3c8ae4ef446f32cccc7affcf2d9612a7bc73a19f7821264a8b0f64f
```

DECRYPT--> You can run the program from the bash command by running the statement:

```sh
go run main.go DEC 26a8d6a84be3c8ae4ef446f32cccc7affcf2d9612a7bc73a19f7821264a8b0f64f
```

The result is something like:

```sh
PasswordToEncrypt
```
If you want you can generate an executable code, see section "Building for source"

#### Building for source

For production release move to directory program es: c:\Users\MYNAME\Go\src and past the code:

```sh
env GOOS=target-OS GOARCH=target-architecture go build package-import-path
```

Example is for LINUX release:
```sh
env GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build main.go
```
You are generating a build for linux distribution called "main" in the same directory,
if you want you can create a package with other name, use this code:

```sh
go build -o <your desired name>
```
The example before is like:

```sh
env GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o encdec main.go 
```

you can run the executable from a SHELL_EXEC in the same way as reported in the "Easy to use" section

you can find all the possible export configurations in the [Table of config contents] section
